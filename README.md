# Protest against

Feel like protesting against some injustice? I created this somewhat silly web app using free open source technologies to make online protesting as easy and fun as possible!

The default value is "TRUMP" but you can protest against any topic you like ðŸ“¢

The source code is still very hacky since I wanted to get this out of the door, but Iâ€™ll clean it up soon (I promise ðŸ˜†).

## Credits

`Protest against` was inspired by Sara Vieira's (@NikkitaFTW) fun apps to create music together.

Thatâ€™s also probably a much better way to spent your time, but sometimes you gotta make a stand for your political cause.

## Future

Iâ€™ve got many ideas for improvements, like:

- [ ] start a counterdemonstration on same page (two columns)
- [ ] start a riot!
- [ ] call the police (if many people do that the protest will be closed down!)
- [ ] let protester shout short chat messages
- [ ] more sound effects
- [ ] custom protester icons!
